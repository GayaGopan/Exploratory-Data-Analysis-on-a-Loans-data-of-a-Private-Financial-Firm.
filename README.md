# Objectives:
# Importing the data into python notebook.
#  Check the Variables names following the Naming Convention.
# Check the information: Data type Conversions.
# Checking the relevant and irrelevant variables in the first phase of EDA.
# Data Duplicacy: Chech if their is duplicate data or not: DDT ( Data Duplicacy Treatment).
# Missing Values Treatment.
# Separating the categorical Variables and Numerical variables into two different datasets for Data Preparations for Data Analysis.
# Filling missing values in Numerical data with the Median values.
# Filling missing values in Categorical data with the Mode values.
# Outlier Treatment.
